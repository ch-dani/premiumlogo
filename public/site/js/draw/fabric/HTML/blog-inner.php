                <p class="comn-txt">Not a lot of people are aware of the benefits of introducing CBD in their daily life. Thankfully, with every passing year, awareness is only increasing. People are no more viewing CBD as a “prohibited“ element. It has become so much more than that.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">At the moment, the entire cannabis industry is being valued at $13.7 billion. Even though this number is impressive, it becomes even more impactful for a specific reason. The reason is the fact that there are usually many limitations placed on the chemical. But, cannabis has still managed to overcome it.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">What is even more impressive is the estimated growth in the industry. Yes, as per experts, the cannabis industry will be valued at $66.3 billion. In addition to this, the predicted growth is supposed to take place by the year 2025. Surely you can imagine the demand that cannabis and its derivatives are enjoying at the moment!</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">The increase in the demand for CBD has not gone unnoticed by the different brands. Acting like true businessmen, many people have decided to try their hands in CBD.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">There are many see very bands who are operating in the industry. Every brand has introduced its own set of products. While a wide range of products is decided this for buyers. But, it can also be an intimidating task to select the correct product from the correct brand.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">To make things easier for you, we are going to discuss the ideologies of two renowned CBD brands. The brands that we are going to pit against each other are:</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">WTP Hemp and Lazarus Naturals. So, let the battle begin!</p>
                <img src="images/inr-img1.png" alt="" class="comn-img">
                <h3 class="comn-hdg">An introduction To The CBD Chemical: What Makes This Chemical Cannabinoid So Special?</h3>
                <p class="comn-txt">The CBD chemical stands for Cannabidiol. It is a naturally-occurring chemical that is found growing in the Cannabis Sativa plant. Since it is a Cannabis derivative, a lot of people associate CBD with euphoria. This is not the case in reality though.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">The CBD chemical is a non-psychoactive element. In other words, users will not get high when you consume the chemical. This will remain uniform even in cases when you consume a higher amount of CBD. The biggest advantage of CBD is that it can reduce the symptoms of many health issues. That too without the risk of getting intoxicated.</p>
                
                <h3 class="comn-hdg">What is CBD Oil?</h3>
                <p class="comn-txt">There is a common misconception where people mistake CBD and CBD oil to be the same. You see, the CBD chemical is the extract that is derived from the Cannabis plant. When the CBD chemical is mixed with a carrier oil, we get CBD oil. This carrier oil can be coconut oil, olive oil, or hemp seed oil. </p>
                <p class="comn-txt">As a buyer, the advantage that you have is you get to enjoy the goodness of CBD as well as a carrier oil. This can help to promote the overall well being of your mental and physical health. In fact, even the neurological well-being of the mind can be effectively maintained.</p>
                
                <h3 class="comn-hdg">So, why do you get high when you consume cannabis?</h3>
                <img src="images/inr-img2.png" alt="" class="comn-img">
                <p class="comn-txt">You must be wondering why cannabis is linked to euphoria if CBD is not psychoactive. Well, it is the presence of another chemical known as THC which is responsible for this. The cannabis Sativa plant can have about 80 to 200 types of chemical cannabinoids. CBD and THC are just one of those many chemical cannabinoids. But yes, these two chemicals are also the most prominent chemicals.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is a psychoactive element of the cannabis plant. This chemical can disturb the consciousness of the user. To be more precise, THC can alter the cognitive functioning of the user along with the brain functions. Cognitive functioning includes mental functions as well as physical movement and coordination.</p>
                <p class="comn-txt">It is due to these factors why THC is not a legal substance. Having said this, CBD is legal and can be freely used. You only need to ascertain that the total THC traces do not exceed more than 0.3 percent. </p>
                
                <h3 class="comn-hdg">WTP Hemp Vs. Lazarus Naturals: Company Profile And Offered Products</h3>
